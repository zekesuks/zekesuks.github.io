### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was one of my favorite labs all year because it was the first lab where I actually felt challenged and got confused on the subject matter at hand. Part one was called BMR where me and my partner had to create a program where the user was prompted to enter their gender, weight, height and age and then they would receive the amount of calories that they should eat a day according to their body mass index. This lab truly changed my perspective, not because of the actual problem, but because I learned how we can use this extremely complex tool in the real world. I felt like I was understanding how the world works on a much deeper level. Every single person I know owns some type of computer and I felt like I was a little more connected to the computers that I own because I was able to debunk the mystery of how these complex images are taking up my screen and how they are created to serve some purpose. Lab 3 helped me gain a new perspective on life and made me appreciate the computer science field as a whole.
    
* Lab 6
    I love the game of blackjack, in fact I play it with my friends all the time, so when I was able to program my own version using c++ I was ecstatic. I had to make sure the program was able to accept only two cards that were either card numbers or face cards and no other values. I then had to deal with the tricky ace card, which was frustrating because an ace can be a one or an eleven depending on the player's hand. I was able to adjust the total score of the hand using an if statement that determined if an ace being an eleven was appropriate.

* Lab 10
    Lab 10 introduced me to 2d vectors, and at the beginning I was extremely confused on how I was supposed to tackle the obstacle. Wrapping my mind around 2d vectors was really hard for me, I could see what I was supposed to so in my head, but I was having trouble actually portraying that idea in my code. I received help from my lab professor and they explained it to me with pencil and paper and as they were explaining, it clicked in my head. In the program me and my partner had to navigate a vector of vectors of strings and convert all strings on the second column into integers while retaining the string type on the first column. This process broadened my idea of how huge quantities of information can be stored.
